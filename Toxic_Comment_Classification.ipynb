              "  '\"\\n\\nYOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.\\n\\nHe first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a \"\"baby killer\"\" for being in the military\\n\\nNo, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.\\n\\nThen he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late \\'06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC\\'s Countdown. That\\'s how it became a national story.\\n\\nIn the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez\\'s past.\\n\\nSanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled \"\"Bi Conflict,\"\" but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not \"\"homosexual/bisexual films.\"\" He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.\\n\\nThere has been no \"\"insinuation\"\" of \"\"rumors.\"\" Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.com\\n\\nSanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater \"\"an underground railroad\"\" for fallen gay right-wingers.\\n\\nCalling Bluemental \"\"a committed left-wing ideologue\"\" is straight out of an O\\'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia\\'s purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez \"\"revealed\"\" that Countdown \"\"never bothered\"\" to contact him.\\n\\nCritics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.\\n\\nThe use of the phrase \"\"rumors from anonymous bloggers\"\" is straight out of an O\\'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia\\'s purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called \"\"rumors\"\" have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.\\n\\nIn an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.\"\"[24]\\n\\nFirst off, whatever he claimed that he had \"\"wanted\"\" to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he \"\"wanted\"\" to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing \"\"ex-gay\"\" blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some \"\"neutrality\"\" you people show!\\n\\nA later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran\\'s Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]\\n\\nExcuse me, but Sanchez\\'s denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn\\'t have to succeed to be extortion.\\n\\nThere is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez\\'s various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not \"\"neutral\"\" to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?\"'],\n",

What you suggest, some form of moral policing I suppose, is utterly wrong. Who would determine what reliable sources are reporting in a way seemingly transphobic? Also, I believe there is a previous administrative action case of Wikipedians describing fellow editors asIslamophobic, because it\\'s very close to a personal attack (especially as some people felt it concerns commenting another editor\\'s mental state, an accusation of a medical phobia).

As nominal GDP represents total market value, it is most frequently used when talking about superpowers. India has a larger PPP GDP, but Russia has a much higher per capita GDP than India in both categories. Overall, Russia has a higher HDI index. Your statement that India has a higher GDP than Russia is accurate in only a narrow sense and based on a single GDP calculation. 71.112.145.211  \\n\\nIndia is way ahead of Russia in terms of GDP (PPP) (see List of countries by GDP (PPP)) and just behind Russia in terms of GDP (nominal) (see List of countries by GDP (nominal)). We are talking over here national economies and not just economy from per capita perspective. Also, India has a higher GDP growth rate than Russia (see List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate) and according to BRIC report, India\\'s GDP (nominal) will be four times that of Russia\\'s by 2050 and that is a very important factor considering this is an article on potential superpowers.   \\n\\n India is not way ahead of Russia, Russia is way ahead of India. Everything in India is Russian suchs as military arsenals, rockets, missiles, fight jets, commercial jets, ships, subs and etc. Russia is a superpower and India is not quite a superpower. There are many reasons why Russia is a superpower and that is a long discussion. Russia is the number military forces in the world and the worlds largest military arsenal builder. India is a big population and smart people but Russia is has unique things about it that India hasn\\'t.  \\xe2\\x80\\x94Preceding unsigned comment added by 78.129.197.69   \\n\\nThe bigger issue here, however, is those little bar charts.

            "Original: b\"Long wave, because of the long wavelength, needs impractically large antennas to broadcast with any reasonable efficiency. The tallest ever man-made structure before the Burj Khalifa was a longwave transmitter: Warsaw radio mast. Its ground wave range is also relatively long compared to medium wave, which means that the transmissions will reach out over a much wider area (1000 km is not unusual). That may sound like an advantage, but at such low frequencies, bandwidth is at a premium, so the longwave band has to be rather small (it's just over 100 kHz wide in Europe). Combine those two effects, and and what happens is that a single medium-powered transmitter will swamp a very large area, making that frequency unusable to anyone else, and taking away almost 10% of the available frequency space within that wide area. So the longwave band is good purely from a transmission effectiveness point of view (if you ignore lightning interference) but it doesn't work too well on a economical/commercial level. This is one of the reasons the FM band was moved from 50 MHz to its modern place after WW2: the higher frequencies are much more strongly localised to one area, so there is room for a lot more stations in a given space and stations can cater more easily to smaller, local audiences, which keeps costs down and attracts more people. A longwave transmitter for a single large city is silly, but for VHF it works.\"\n",

I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.\\n\\nBut you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I\\'m some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I\\n\\n\\'m here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!  \\n(Remember, you can\\'t say you were \\'just joking\\' because, as we\\'ve learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say \\'I was joking\\' when you make your statment, it means you\\'re as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)\\n\\nAnyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?\\n\\nAs for your arguement - \"\"we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed...\"\" I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol! \\n\\nI find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you\\'d use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.\\n\\nSo, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I\\'ve understood that Move-On\\'s petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.\\n\\nAnd I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group\\'s statements.

And what I\\'ve seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it\\'s good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don\\'t think I\\'m the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I\\'m used to getting rebuked for \\'getting away from content\\' or \\'talking politics.\\' Funny, how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke.

Regarding the usual claims by advocate 202.63.42.221, sourcing must be the basis for the article. The claim that \"\"or to his devotees\"\" is POV fails to consider the source itself. The Adidam source clearly states that \"\"...\"\"Adi Da\"\" is the principal Name of Avatar Adi Da Samraj...\"\"; that devotees recognize him as the \"\"...Primordial Being, the Source of all, the Original Divine Person, Daand He is the Avatar, the bodily Revelation of that One...\"\"; that \"\"Samraj\"\" is a Title for Avatar Adi Da, which He was offered by His devotees in 1996. \"\"Samraj\"\" means the \"\"Universal Ruler\"\", or \"\"Supreme Lord\"\"...\"\".; To address Adi Da as \"\"Ruchira\"\" (Sanskrit for \"\"radiant\"\") is acknowledge Him as \"\"the Radiant, Shining, \\'Bright\\' One\"\"...when Avatar Adi Da\\'s devotees use it in reference to Him, they intend it in the sense of \"\"The One Who Is, Self-Radiant, Inherently (or Perfectly Subjectively) \\'Bright\\', Self-Enlightened, and Eternally Awake\"\"...\"\". And \"\"...He took the Name of Adi Da Samraj. And more fully, in 1997: Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj. This Nameoffered to Him by His devoteesdescribes His present Revelation. He is \"\"Adi\"\", the Source-Person, the First and Only Person, The Divine Person of Love-Bliss. He is \"\"Da Love-Ananda\"\", the Giver of Love-Bliss to all. And He is \"\"Samraj\"\"the Divine King, the Master of Reality, serving all by the Transmission of His Heart-Awakening Grace; andin their right relationship to Him (Dseer note: an Adidam euphemism for devotion) being served by all, so that all may fully receive that Transmission, and Realize the Divine....\"\".\\n\\nNot only does this source clearly state the Adidam position that \"\"to address Adi Da as \"\"Ruchira\"\" (Sanskrit for \"\"radiant\"\") is acknowledge Him as \"\"the Radiant, Shining, \\'Bright\\' One\"\", which those outside the group or not in sympathy with it (non-devotees) would not acknowledge, but a google search for \"\"Ruchira Avatar Adi Da Samraj\"\" confirms that what comes up in any signficant order, excluding this article itself, for that title, is either Adidam sites and material or that of devotees. There is no thus evidence to support your claim that non-devotees would routinely refer to him by anything other than \"\"Adi Da\"\" (his primary name per the source), his name during the controversial period (Da Free John), or his given name of Franklin Jones today, rather than \"\"the Ruichira Avatar Adi Da Samraj\"\" (meaning \"\"the radiant avatar, primordial giver, universal ruler\"\"), or as \"\"Beloved\"\" either, which as per the source, devotees would use. Thus, \"\"or to his devotees as...\"\" and defining what the titles and names mean to devotees, is perfectly appropriate and informative. \\n\\nThe addition of all the names in the intro instead of just a few improves the article because Adi Da has been known by so many names, that it is important for the casual reader to know up front all these are the same person. The introduction isn\\'t excessively long, it is only six sentences. One describes what him, one lists his many names, one sumarizes his dogma, one describes the highly publicized allegations, one lists the Adidam response, and one specifies these charges were settled out of court.

I think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that haven\\'t been statistically proven, which points out several flaws in the statement.  Evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps, but them first appearing the the mid-Cretaceous period is hard to statistically prove.  I suppose this should be changed if I\\'m right, but I may not be.   ~talk \\nThe Cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale. The sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence.   \\nVery true.   ~talk \\n\\n ants \\n\\nwhere do ants mate.\\nhow long do they live.\\ndo they have sex.  \\xe2\\x80\\x94Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.7.207.156   \\n\\nheh, viable question.

I\\'m going to revert it back to the original. Feel free to add sentences or add to the article, but please do not delete the prior material that I wrote, as all of it is true, and from someone who was there from the beginning of the scene. Simply referencing a statement to an article does not make the data relevant. For example, this page is on a sub-genre of House. That does not mean you can include a sentence stating: \"\"Oprah has a new TV network, and they played Techno in the background on one of her shows\"\", and then you provided a reference from the newspaper. The fact that you provided the reference does follow the rules, but the sentence has nothing to do with the article on this page. That\\'s why it was deleted. It could be added to a Disco music page though, or a Techno music page.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t mind me asking, what year did you start collecting \\'Progressive House\\' and what is the oldest record in your collection of it?\\n\\nRegarding the Techno comments. Techno should be mentioned (as the sentence prior to it should be included), but that one sentence I deleted because it has nothing to do with Progressive. Also, Techno in general has little to do with Progressive. Progressive came from the House scene...specifically Acid House and very influenced from the Balearic sound of Ibiza. Techno was an influence but not the primary driver, and very little to do with Detroit.\\n\\nTechnically Progressive House was the next re-branding of House after Acid House, but I\\'m not going to get into this, it\\'s too complicated.\\n\\nIf you have a problem with what is written, can you open the discussion on here, and explain your reasons, and we can both discuss before you start hacking away at the page.

The redirect (which I don't like but that's a battle for another day) goes to PIR, but keep PIR just a tiny little stub that says it sponsors the following websites. Then link to the Wikipedia article for each site. The CIA cookie thing is so trivial, that it can be mentioned in a NameBase article (there's a page about it at http://www.namebase.org/ciascan.html ), or just skipped altogether. Or you could add our www.cia-on-campus.org website (didn't know we had that one, did you?) and mention the cookie thing there. Or add a sentence about Google's cookies, and stick the CIA sentence right next to it in the Google-Watch article. By having these other articles, you can justify keeping PIR just a tiny little stub. This approach is reasonable because the whois info for all my websites shows that the domain registration is technically owned by PIR. Brandt doesn't own the websites, PIR does!

As far as I remember, it went something like this: the owner of Chernomorets Burgas bought Conegliano German (a team from a village next to Sofia) and for various reasons (mainly to get the Burgas team into a higher division without going through the proper means of actually gaining promotion - which is the same as what happened when Akademik Sofia swapped divisions with Vihar Gorublyane, actually, as well as a bunch of other teams such as Pirin Blagoevgrad) merged the two teams, which ended up being called \"\"Chernomorets Burgas (Burgas)\"\" in Group B and \"\"Chernomorets Burgas (Sofia)\"\" in Group A. Then a whole bunch of other stuff happened at the same time such as Burgas municipality founding their OWN team (which they called \"\"Chernomorets (Burgas)\"\" - note the punctuation in all three cases); then a bunch of business deals went down whereby Neftohimik Burgas (which had since been renamed \"\"Naftex\"\") got merged with Pomorie, then that team got merged with one of the Chernomorets\\'es, then the other Chernomorets remained as the \"\"official\"\" Chernomorets, but still there was some dispute over players/grounds/finances...then that eventually merged with the first chernomorets; then the Sofia Chernomorets went back to being Conegliano German, then the Neftohimik fans formed a fans\\' club Neftohimik which began at the lowest level and... in short - before 2000 there was a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas, and after 2010 there is a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas. And between 2000 & 2010 a whole bunch of weird&random; stuff happened that I just don\\'t know how to coherently explain. I reckon they can simply be mentioned in the Chernomorets Burgas and Neftochimic Burgas 1986 articles as something along the lines of: \"\"various business dealings led to the formation and dissolution of several clubs including \"\"Ch.B.B\"\", \"\"Ch.B.S.\"\" and \"\"Ch(B.)\"\" and, ultimately, led to the current state of the team\"\". Or something equally inane. I dont know...

The second change is a little more subtle, but still extremely notable.

One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be \"\"sourced\"\" to a \"\"reliable source,\"\" which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe\\'s birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of \"\"Advanced.\"\" A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT.\\n\\nUnfortunately, insider information like knowing JM\\'s son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this. One of my younger brothers is Terry Moran, and for several years the Wikipedia article had the wrong birth year for him. This was because the ABC News website had the wrong year - but I could not change the year and say \"\"he\\'s my brother and I know when he was born.\"\" I had to find a published source that confirmed the correct date. That\\'s how things work here. I hope you\\'ll enjoy editing article here at Wikipedia! Regards,   \"'\n",

It seems at the end of the day, I'm convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.\\n\\nWhen I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you're interested in as well outside your original main content. Try stretching outwards a little - perhaps the history of the British Parliament as a whole, and our articles on parliamentary procedure need to be updated badly and are Americentric. I sincerely hope you good luck in your endeavors.\"\n",

A bass could be: a tuba, a low voice, the Basso voice range. Bass guitars and guitars simply have more in common than the bass guitar and the double bass, which belongs to the violin family, while the (electric) bass/bass guitar does not. Note the first (commercially successful) bass guitar: it was built by Leo Fender, not by Stradivarius!\\nDifferences between bass guitar and double bass:\\n playing technique: one may use a bow for the double bass\\n design: the bass guitar is a direct derivative of the guitar (both electric and acoustic), while the double bass was derived from the violoncello\\n octave: the bass guitar is one octave lower than the guitar, the double bass an extra octave lower\\n\\nAdd to this that the number of electrified bass instruments may increase in the near future, further reducing the clarity of \"\"electric bass\"\".\\nIMHO an encyclopedia should be clear and properly categorised. Electric bass instead of (electric) bass guitar does not meet that standard.  15:10, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)\"'\n",

Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael \"\"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950\"\" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher \"\"Decisive Moments\"\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).\\n\\nCandid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the fifties, sixties and seventies.\\n\\nIn line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimages which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher \"\"Unguarded Moments\"\", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick \"\"Candid Camera\"\" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.\\n\\nPhotographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,'\n",

As often as that is the case, we can remove one of the references, and just refer to it in both places.  This takes some real editorial work, but I would not be at all surprised if such work could eliminate 1/3 or even 1/2 of the references as redundant, while still keeping the article well compliant with WP:RS and WP:CITE.

Depth of field is a measurement of depth of acceptable sharpness in the object space, or subject space. Depth of focus, however, is a measurement of how much distance exists behind the lens wherein the film plane will remain sharply in focus. It can be viewed as the flip side of depth of field, occurring on the opposite side of the lens. Where depth of field often can be measured in macroscopic units such as meters and feet, depth of focus is typically measured in microscopic units such as fractions of a millimeter or thousandths of an inch. Since the measurement indicates the tolerance of the film\\'s displacement within the camera, depth of focus is sometimes referred to as \"\"lens-to-film tolerance.\"\"\"'\n",

It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as \"\"disruptive.\"\" Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don\\'t feel that I have done so because as far as I\\'m concerned I\\'ve acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.\\n\\nIf you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I\\'m all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?\\n\\nIf you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I\\'ve been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that\\'s not very positive.\\n\\nWhy not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it\\'s who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?\\n\\nDo you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn\\'t be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That\\'s not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?\\n\\nLet\\'s face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. \\n\\nWhy should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist\\'s POV, which BTW, I don\\'t agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it\\'s false or that I\\'m POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.\\n\\nWhat am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. \\n\\nKatherine Yurica\\'s and TheocracyWatch\\'s POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don\\'t represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it\\'s the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.\\n\\nI suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don\\'t know him, and he hasn\\'t exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. \\n\\nHave you ever stopped to think, it\\'s not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I\\'ve said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.\\n\\nSo far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.\\n\\nCould you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That\\'s constructive in my view. \\n\\nInstead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.\\n\\nMaybe you\\'ve been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.\\n\\nEvery time I do anything, from asking people what they think about the rules, or my ideas for improving Wikipedia, I get written up on this RfC. Flo, please don\\'t take this personally,  \\n90 percent of the time, I simply forget to login, not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging'\n",

            "Sentence: b'\"\\n\\n A lot of points to respond to.\\nAleenf1 - you once again ignored the fact (or are being misleading intentionally) about national titles.  On Wikipedia pages, we use China, Laos, Palestine, Iran, etc. when those are NOT the official IOC designations.  Not only are those now the official names, those are not even the official IOC designations.  Yet, we still use them without question.  It is only with the situation of Taiwan that you make an issue of it.  I am not even proposing the sole use of Taiwan, just it\\'s mention as a parenthetical.  Otherwise, I insist that you use People\\'s Republic of China, Lao People\\'s Democratic Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, Palestinian Authority, ETC. as those are the IOC designations for those countries.  THAT is where your hypocrisy lies.\\nRebskii - People SEE Chinese Taipei, but they don\\'t know it is Taiwan.  Why do you think one of Taiwan\\'s gold medal winners had to declare before the international press in Athens, in English, \"\"I am from Taiwan.\"\"?  It is because there is much confusion among people.  I spoke with a couple of Australian baseball fans who made the trip from Australia to see the 2006 Intercontinental Cup here in Taichung.  They didn\\'t know that Chinese Taipei was in fact Taiwan until they started making plans for the trip.  It is not even universally known among sports fans, much less the general public.\\nAs for the domains of Taiwan, Orchid Island and Green Island, among others, are historically linked with Taiwan and have long been administratively a part of Taiwan.  The only counties that are not historically part of Taiwan are the tiny islands with some 10,000 people off the coast of Fujian which produces none of our athletes.  Taiwan is the commonly used phrase on the street domestically, not ROC and not Chinese Taipei.\\nWe are not bound by the opinions and illegal claims of barbarous dictators in Beijing.  \\nIf you look at the good article guidelines, one of them is that the article should provide appropriate information for people who are not necessarily familiar with the subject.  Simply stating Chinese Taipei does not meet that standard because few people know what it is.  A simple parenthetical (Taiwan) beside Chinese Taipei accomplishes one of the standards of good article writing with very little trouble.\\nAgain, if you insist on ONLY Chinese Taipei because that is the IOC designation, then use all of the other IOC designations for the other countries I have listed above.\\n \"'\n",

Would appreciate a little room / time to work on this one - since it is not patent nonsense although it may appear so at first blush.  \\n\\nI will reply for Dreadstar, and he can respond  if he needs to. Let me first explain the concept of verifiability, which is a core pillar of Wikipedia. Another thing is notability, which basically means that you can create an acronym about something, but that does not make it automatically notable. Without citations to reliable, third-party sources (such as news articles, professional journal articles, magazine articles, etc.,), then articles are likely to be deleted. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and, additionally, I would like to point you to the conflict of interest guideline, because your username is the same as the title of the article. The COI guideline explains that editors should not create or edit articles about themselves, their company, organization, product, or family or friends, as they would likely be unable to edit neutrally. Neutrality is another of Wikipedia\\'s core policies. I\\'d encourage you to review the policies and guidelines given here, and once you have, consider if indeed, the article you submitted was verifiable by multiple reliable sources, and displayed notability. Cheers! Ariel\\xe2\\x99\\xa5Gold\\n\\nThanks Ariel, better get some foot warmers for that poor doggie!   \\xe2\\x80\\xa0 \\n\\nDogsoc, the article consisted of an acronym and six sentences describing what the acronym meant, none of which was verifiable per WP:Verifiability, and which miserably failed Wikipedia:Notability.  The only claim to verifiability was a presumed \"\"xerox copy\"\" of an \"\"underground magazine\"\" published in 1976 purportedly recently acquired and alleged to be undergoing the \"\"process of being translated and scanned.\"\"  The contents of the article, although short, were quite inflammatory, making unfounded accusations against governmental \"\"regulatory assassins\"\", etc.  All in all, it added up to, quite frankly, patent nonsense with no meaningful content.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa0 \\n\\nDreadstar, Wiki has many articles devoted to acronyms (such as United Nations, United States of America). Referring to the recently acquired document, there is now a stay order of the concerned High Court on publication of this document. We can *Now* cite the judgement\\'s link on an OFFICIAL Govt. High Court website (which ought to meet reputable source /verificability criteria). For DOGSOC notability a simple google (is this verifiable?) news search on \"\"Nandigram\"\" should do. Finally I may mention Wikipedia\\'s Neutral Point of View Policy which is absolutely non-negotiable.  \\nDogsoc, you do not seem to have read the links provided to you. You say \"\"DOGSOC\"\" is on Google, but here is the Google search result for DOGSOC  with a total of  one article from 1910, not related to this article you are claiming is notable. The words you said it stands for, \"\"Dismantling our Governments Selling our Cities\"\", a Google search comes up with again, nothing:  None of this has anything to do with POV, it has to do with, again, verifiability and reliable, third-party sources that establish the notability. Yes, USA, UN, and many, many other acronyms have pages here, but they are notable, mentioned in the news, media, and other reliable sources. This acronym is not. Further, you may wish to review the single purpose account guide as well. Thanks, Ariel[[Special:C'\n",

            "Sentence: b'\"\\n\\n Newly Discovered Documentary Evidence That Affects this Article\\'s Accuracy\\n\\nI have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers:\\n\\nSome people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What\\'s the truth?\\n\\nYou yourself must realize what is the truth.\\n\\nSo God cannot teach anything, except through a Master?\\n\\nWhat is God?  You don\\'t know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It\\'s power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium.\\n\\nWhy does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary?\\n\\nAre you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can\\'t drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What\\'s why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs.\\n\\nIs the living Master able to reveal Knowledge?\\n\\nYes, that\\'s why you call him a living Master. \\n\\nGuru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same?\\n\\nAt His time there were not so many doctors, that\\'s why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That\\'s why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature.\\n\\nWhat happens to a person\\'s karma when they receive Knowledge?\\n\\nIt starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you\\'ve got to go and be one with God.\\n\\nWill this Knowledge save us from rebirth?\\n\\nYes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.  \\n\\nGuru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness?\\n\\n......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.  \\n\\nThe lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it\\'s a quote that reads:\\n\\n\"\"I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.\"\"\\n\\nHe signs this last quote:\\n\\n\"\"Guru Maharaj Ji\"\"\\n\\nI maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat\\'s then-website wherein he said:\\n\\nPeople through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the \"\"old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.\"\" I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, \"\"You need peace.\"\" When people said, \"\"Tell us of the scriptures,\"\" I said, \"\"Look within you.\"\" When people asked, \"\"What is your qualification?\"\" I said, \"\"Judge me by what I offer.\"\" To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same. \\n\\nLong after Rawat was \"\"only eight\"\" he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn\\'t cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor'\n",

Dane was currently there with his father who was doing a comeback at the 2005 Country Music Awards. In the interview, Dane confessed that got teased a lot at school and the other kids made it tough. \"\"I am not gay, no where near it, and I nkow that for a fact\"\" were some of the wrds Dane used. In the interview, Dane also stated that he did not want to go into \"\"the business\"\" because he like it so much better in Australia where his father and family were left alone by media. \\n  In late 2006 Dane\\'s relationship with his father soured when his father married Alison Brennan. \"\"I hate her\"\" Dane has been quoted as saying previously to the couples marriage.\\n  In early 2007 Dane become a first time Uncle, his nephew Leonardo, born May, suffered respiritury problems but the final word was he\\'s \"\"doing fine now...\"\" stated from Dane\\'s sister in late 2007.\\n  In late 2007 Dane had a thumb operation for a rare benighn tumour in his thumb.

The new section also seems to have a bit of a WP:POV issue. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rectify the situation myself, but the page is protected. I understand you have some history with the article so I thought you might want to know about it.\"\"\\n\\nBinksternet:   \"\"The added material is far too promotional for TIGHAR. I would like to ask why you, the IP editor from Northern Mississippi, did not remove the text yourself. It is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about Earhart. Nevertheless, I am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so.\"\"\\n\\nAfter I finished laughing I started to write a reply, but I realized that if Binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply.  I also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless.  I am well aware of my own location.\\n\\nThis is not the first time that Binksternet has started shit with me.  Back in November I had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with Binksternet when I tried to correct a problem with Grey School of Wizardry.\\n\\nBinksternet indicates (in a picture) on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required.  And while he is entitled to his own opinion, he isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at IP editors.\\n\\nThe last time I wanted to fix a problem with the Earhart article I asked Dougweller to do it, and he was agreeable.  I see now that I should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator, but I had thought it would be helpful to alert Binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t normally edit the article.\\n\\nWould you please explain to Binksternet that:\\n\\n1.  I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t edit the article because it is protected and I have already explained that in my first post.\\n\\n2.  It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t civil to baselessly accuse IP editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve Wikipedia and operating in good-faith.\\n\\n3.
